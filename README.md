## My process

The challenge was meant for mobile and desktop only, but I also made it responsive, at least for it to not look awful on screens larger than 375px wide.

Some of the text might look different from the original design, since I fixed a few typos here and there.

My CSS is currently a bit disorganised, will tidy it up one of these days. (Narrator: 'She did not, in fact, tidy her CSS up.')

### Built with

- Figma: used to measure things like padding, border radii, margins, etc. I do not have a Pro account, thus no Figma source file. I just measured from the provided design screenshots.
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass (First time using Sass! ðŸ˜³)
